# scResponseDynamics
The context-dependent dynamics of single-cell inducible gene expression in macrophages.

To run the functions for scREAL-TIME: library(scREALTIME) \
The run_compile.R file contains code for the analysis in Figures 1-6. \
Figure 1: using the scREAL-TIME algorithm and plotting the output \
Figure 2: plotting of scRNAseq data from stimulated macrophages\
Figure 3: calculating trajectory feature values and mutual information analysis \
Figure 4: analysis of gene-gene correlations across trajectory features for single cells \
Figure 5: comparison of single-cell response dynamics for different macrophage polarization states \
Figure 6: identification of cell state based on single-cell response dynamics
