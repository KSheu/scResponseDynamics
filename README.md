# scResponseDynamics
Stimulus-induced gene expression dynamics in single cells (Sheu et al.)

See installation instructions for the scREAL-TIME R package under the scREALTIME subfolder. \
The run_compile.R file contains code for the analysis in Figures 1-7. \
Figure 1: simulation of scGETs using mathematical models \
Figure 2: evaluation of imputed scGETs against simulated ground truth \
Figure 3: plotting of scRNAseq data from stimulated macrophages and use of the scREAL-TIME algorithm \
Figure 4: calculating trajectory feature values and mutual information analysis \
Figure 5: analysis of gene-gene correlations across trajectory features for single cells \
Figure 6: comparison of single-cell response dynamics for different macrophage polarization states \
Figure 7: identification of cell state based on single-cell response dynamics
