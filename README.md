# scResponseDynamics
The context-dependent dynamics of single-cell inducible gene expression in macrophages.

To obtain the functions for the single-cell response dynamics imputation algorithm: source(trajectory4.R) \n
The run_compile.R file contains code for the analysis in Figures 1-7. \n
Figure 1: plotting of raw data \n
Figure 2: using the imputation algorithm and plotting the output \n
Figure 3: calculating trajectory feature values and mutual information analysis \n
Figure 4: comparison of single-cell response dynamics for different macrophage polarization states \n
Figure 5: analysis of gene-gene correlations across trajectory features for single cells \n
Figure 6: application of the Response Specificity Profile to trajectory features \n
