# scResponseDynamics
Stimulus-induced gene expression dynamics in single cells (Sheu et al.)

See installation instructions for the scREAL-TIME R package under the scREALTIME subfolder. \
The run_compile.R file contains code for the analysis in Figures 2-6. \
Figure 2: plotting of scRNAseq data from stimulated macrophages and use of the scREAL-TIME algorithm \
Figure 3: calculating trajectory feature values and mutual information analysis \
Figure 4: analysis of gene-gene correlations across trajectory features for single cells \
Figure 5: comparison of single-cell response dynamics for different macrophage polarization states \
Figure 6: identification of cell state based on single-cell response dynamics
